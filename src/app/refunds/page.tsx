                </p>

                <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
                <p>
                  Lexci Innovations provides customized technology and professional services. Since most of our services involve dedicated time, technical resources, research, design, and development efforts, refunds are limited and subject to the conditions below.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Services Covered</h2>

                </ul>

                <h2>3. Advance Payments</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>All advance payments made for project initiation are generally non-refundable once work has commenced.</li>
                  <li>Project work is considered commenced when requirement gathering begins, design work starts, development environment is created, technical planning is initiated, or any deliverable is shared with the client.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Cancellation by Client</h2>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Before Work Starts</h3>
                <p>
                  If the client cancels the project before any work has started, a refund may be considered after deducting payment gateway charges, banking charges, and administrative processing charges.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">After Work Starts</h3>
                <p>
                  If the client cancels the project after work has started, no refund will be provided for completed work. The client must pay for work completed up to the cancellation date, and any unpaid dues become immediately payable.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Milestone-Based Projects</h2>

Refunds for such services are governed by the respective third-party provider policies.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Change of Mind</h2>
                <p>Refunds will not be issued for change of business plans, change of mind, internal management decisions, budget constraints arising after project confirmation, or lack of client availability or delayed feedback.</p>

                <h2>10. Delay in Client Communication</h2>
                <p>
                  If the client fails to provide required information, approvals, content, or feedback for more than 30 consecutive days, the project may be marked inactive. Payments already made will remain non-refundable.
                </p>

                <h2>11. Service Deficiency</h2>
                <p>If the client believes the delivered service materially deviates from the agreed scope:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The client must notify Lexci Innovations in writing within 7 days of delivery.</li>
                  <li>We will review the concern and provide reasonable rectification opportunities.</li>
                  <li>Refunds will be considered only if we are unable to deliver the agreed scope after reasonable remediation attempts.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>12. Refund Processing</h2>
                <p>
                  Approved refunds will be processed within 7-15 business days through the original payment method whenever possible. Processing time may vary depending on banks and payment providers.
                </p>

                <h2>13. Chargebacks</h2>
                <p>
                  Clients agree to contact Lexci Innovations before initiating any payment dispute or chargeback. Unauthorized chargebacks may result in suspension of services, termination of agreements, and recovery proceedings for completed work.
                </p>

                <h2>14. Termination by Lexci Innovations</h2>
                <p>
                  We reserve the right to terminate services if the client violates contractual terms, engages in unlawful activities, abuses our staff, or fails to make payments as agreed. In such cases, refunds will not be provided for work completed or resources allocated.
                </p>

                <h2>15. Force Majeure</h2>
